What You Will Learn Access, manipulate, and display geospatial data from within your Python programs Master the core geospatial concepts of location, distance, units, projections, and datums Read and write geospatial data in both vector and raster format Perform complex, real-world geospatial calculations using Python Store and access geospatial information in a database Use points, lines, and polygons within your Python programs Convert geospatial data into attractive maps using Python-based tools Build complete web-based mapping applications using Python In Detail Geospatial development links your data to locations on the surface of the Earth. Writing geospatial programs involves tasks such as grouping data by location, storing and analyzing large amounts of spatial information, performing complex geospatial calculations, and drawing colorful interactive maps. In order to do this well, you'll need appropriate tools and techniques, as well as a thorough understanding of geospatial concepts such as map projections, datums, and coordinate systems. This book provides an overview of the major geospatial concepts, data sources, and toolkits. It starts by showing you how to store and access spatial data using Python, how to perform a range of spatial calculations, and how to store spatial data in a database. Further on, the book teaches you how to build your own slippy map interface within a web application, and finishes with the detailed construction of a geospatial data editor using the GeoDjango framework. By the end of this book, you will be able to confidently use Python to write your own geospatial applications ranging from quick, one-off utilities to sophisticated web-based applications using maps and other geospatial data.

It covers all the built-in functionality, as well as key components of Python's standard library. Structured so readers can write Python programs from chapter 1, each subsequent chapter provides further depth and broader coverage. Two new chapters have been added to this edition increasing the coverage to include parsing, debugging, testing, and profiling. Readers will master Python procedural and object-oriented techniques; creation of custom modules and packages; writing and reading files; multithreading; networking; database programming; GUIs; regular expressions; application debugging, testing, and profiling; and more. Detailed appendices include coverage of migrating applications from Python 2 to Python 3, plus a complete language reference.

In the early days, a team of engineers might have had to look after one or two systems. These days, one engineer can administer hundreds or thousands of systems. System administrators are gradually replacing their tools with more advanced and flexible ones. One of the choices is Python. Structurally, Python is a modern, high-level language with a very clean syntax. Python comes with many built-in libraries that can make automation tasks easier. It also has extensive set of third-party libraries and a very active development community. This flexibility makes Python a good choice for a wide variety of tasks, from prototyping science applications to system maintenance and administration jobs. This book explains and shows how to apply Python scripting in practice. Unlike the majority of the Python books, it will show you how to approach and resolve real-world issues that most system administrators will come across in their careers. In this book, you will find several projects in the categories of network administration, web server administration, and monitoring and database management. In each project, we will define the problem, design the solution, and go through the more interesting implementation steps. Each project is accompanied with the source code of a fully working prototype, which you’ll be able to use immediately or adapt to your requirements and environment. What you’ll learn Solve real-world system administration problems using Python. Manage devices with SNMP and SOAP. Build a distributed monitoring system. Manage web applications and parse complex log files. Automatically monitor and manage MySQL databases. Who this book is for This book is primarily aimed at experienced system administrators whose day-to-day tasks involve looking after and managing small-to-medium-sized server estates. It will also be beneficial for system administrators who want to learn more about automation and want to apply their Python knowledge to solve various system administration problems. Python developers will also benefit from reading this book, especially if they are involved in developing automation and management tools.

In the early days, a team of engineers might have had to look after one or two systems. These days, one engineer can administer hundreds or thousands of systems. System administrators are gradually replacing their tools with more advanced and flexible ones. One of the choices is Python. Structurally, Python is a modern, high-level language with a very clean syntax. Python comes with many built-in libraries that can make automation tasks easier. It also has extensive set of third-party libraries and a very active development community. This flexibility makes Python a good choice for a wide variety of tasks, from prototyping science applications to system maintenance and administration jobs. This book explains and shows how to apply Python scripting in practice. Unlike the majority of the Python books, it will show you how to approach and resolve real-world issues that most system administrators will come across in their careers. In this book, you will find several projects in the categories of network administration, web server administration, and monitoring and database management. In each project, we will define the problem, design the solution, and go through the more interesting implementation steps. Each project is accompanied with the source code of a fully working prototype, which you’ll be able to use immediately or adapt to your requirements and environment. What you’ll learn Solve real-world system administration problems using Python. Manage devices with SNMP and SOAP. Build a distributed monitoring system. Manage web applications and parse complex log files. Automatically monitor and manage MySQL databases. Who this book is for This book is primarily aimed at experienced system administrators whose day-to-day tasks involve looking after and managing small-to-medium-sized server estates. It will also be beneficial for system administrators who want to learn more about automation and want to apply their Python knowledge to solve various system administration problems. Python developers will also benefit from reading this book, especially if they are involved in developing automation and management tools. This book assumes that readers already use Python and are comfortable with the language. Most of the Linux distributions come with Python and various libraries (such as Django, PIL and SciPy) packaged and readily available, but basic knowledge of installing packages in a Linux/Unix environment is advised.

Based on the author’s experience working for an agricultural biotechnology company, Python for Bioinformatics helps scientists solve their biological problems by helping them understand the basics of programming. Requiring no prior knowledge of programming-related concepts, the book focuses on the easy-to-use, yet powerful, Python computer language. The book begins with a very basic introduction that teaches the principles of programming. It then introduces the Biopython package, which can be useful in solving life science problems. The next section covers sophisticated tools for bioinformatics, including relational database management systems and XML. The last part illustrates applications with source code, such as sequence manipulation, filtering vector contamination, calculating DNA melting temperature, parsing a genbank file, inferring splicing sites, and more. The appendices provide a wealth of supplementary information, including instructions for installing Python and Biopython and a Python language and style guide. By incorporating examples in biology as well as code fragments throughout, the author places a special emphasis on practice, encouraging readers to experiment with the code.

Examples are applicable for users of both Python 2 and Python 3. If you’re familiar with the basics of Python data analysis, this is an ideal introduction to HDF5. Get set up with HDF5 tools and create your first HDF5 file Work with datasets by learning the HDF5 Dataset object Understand advanced features like dataset chunking and compression Learn how to work with HDF5’s hierarchical structure, using groups Create self-describing files by adding metadata with HDF5 attributes Take advantage of HDF5’s type system to create interoperable files Express relationships among data with references, named types, and dimension scales Discover how Python mechanisms for writing parallel code interact with HDF5', 'allowAnonLogging': False, 'publishedDate': '2013-10-21', 'categories': ['Computers'], 'canonicalVolumeLink': 'https://books.google.com/books/about/Python_and_HDF5.html?hl=&id=lRCMAQAAQBAJ', 'previewLink': 'http://books.google.co.in/books?id=lRCMAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:149194501X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api', 'title': 'Python and HDF5', 'printType': 'BOOK', 'authors': ['Andrew Collette'], 'pageCount': 152, 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781491945018'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '149194501X'}], 'imageLinks': {'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lRCMAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lRCMAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'contentVersion': 'preview-1.0.0'}\n",
