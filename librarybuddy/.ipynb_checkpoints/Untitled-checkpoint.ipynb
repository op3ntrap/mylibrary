Zed Shaw has perfected the world’s best system for becoming a truly effective Python 3.x developer. Follow it and you will succeed—just like the tens of millions of programmers he’s already taught. You bring the discipline, commitment, and persistence; the author supplies everything else. In Learn Python 3 the Hard Way, Zed Shaw taught you the basics of Programming with Python 3. Now, in Learn More Python 3 the Hard Way, you’ll go far beyond the basics by working through 52 brilliantly crafted projects. Each one helps you build a key practical skill, combining demos to get you started and challenges to deepen your understanding. Zed then teaches you even more in 12 hours of online videos, where he shows you how to break, fix, and debug your code. First, you’ll discover how to analyze a concept, idea, or problem to implement in software. Then, step by step, you’ll learn to design solutions based on your analyses and implement them as simply and elegantly as possible. Throughout, Shaw stresses process so you can get started and build momentum, creativity to solve new problems, and quality so you’ll build code people can rely on. Manage complex projects with a programmer’s text editor Leverage the immense power of data structures Apply algorithms to process your data structures Master indispensable text parsing and processing techniques Use SQL to efficiently and logically model stored data Learn powerful command-line tools and skills Combine multiple practices in complete projects It’ll be hard at first. But soon, you’ll just get it—and that will feel great! This course will reward you for every minute you put into it.

Zed Shaw has perfected the world’s best system for becoming a truly effective Python 3.x developer. Follow it and you will succeed—just like the tens of millions of programmers he’s already taught. You bring the discipline, commitment, and persistence; the author supplies everything else. In Learn Python 3 the Hard Way, Zed Shaw taught you the basics of Programming with Python 3. Now, in Learn More Python 3 the Hard Way, you’ll go far beyond the basics by working through 52 brilliantly crafted projects. Each one helps you build a key practical skill, combining demos to get you started and challenges to deepen your understanding. Zed then teaches you even more in 12 hours of online videos, where he shows you how to break, fix, and debug your code. First, you’ll discover how to analyze a concept, idea, or problem to implement in software. Then, step by step, you’ll learn to design solutions based on your analyses and implement them as simply and elegantly as possible. Throughout, Shaw stresses process so you can get started and build momentum, creativity to solve new problems, and quality so you’ll build code people can rely on. Manage complex projects with a programmer’s text editor Leverage the immense power of data structures Apply algorithms to process your data structures Master indispensable text parsing and processing techniques Use SQL to efficiently and logically model stored data Learn powerful command-line tools and skills Combine multiple practices in complete projects It’ll be hard at first. But soon, you’ll just get it—and that will feel great! This course will reward you for every minute you put into it.

This lets you focus on using the network penetration, password cracking, forensics tools and not the OS. This book has the most advanced tools and techniques to reproduce the methods used by sophisticated hackers to make you an expert in Kali Linux penetration testing. First, you are introduced to Kali's top ten tools and other useful reporting tools. Then, you will find your way around your target network and determine known vulnerabilities to be able to exploit a system remotely. Next, you will prove that the vulnerabilities you have found are real and exploitable. You will learn to use tools in seven categories of exploitation tools. Further, you perform web access exploits using tools like websploit and more. Security is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. Passwords are often that weak link. Thus, you learn about password attacks that can be used in concert with other approaches to break into and own a network. Moreover, you come to terms with network sniffing, which helps you understand which users are using services you can exploit, and IP spoofing, which can be used to poison a system's DNS cache. Once you gain access to a machine or network, maintaining access is important. Thus, you not only learn penetrating in the machine you also learn Windows privilege's escalations. With easy to follow step-by-step instructions and support images, you will be able to quickly pen test your system and network.

You\\'re nothing but an arrogant, pointy-headed intellectual — I want you out of my classroom and off the premises in five minutes or I\\'m calling the police and having you arrested for trespassing.\" — Hollywood acting teacher to Randy Olson, former scientist After nearly a decade on the defensive, the world of science is about to be restored to its rightful place. But is the American public really ready for science? And is the world of science ready for the American public? Scientists wear ragged clothes, forget to comb their hair, and speak in a language that even they don\\'t understand. Or so people think. Most scientists don\\'t care how they are perceived, but in our media-dominated age, style points count. Enter Randy Olson. Fifteen years ago, Olson bid farewell to the science world and shipped off to Hollywood ready to change the world. With films like Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus (Tribeca \\'06, Showtime) and Sizzle: A Global Warming Comedy (Outfest \\'08), he has tried to bridge the cultural divide that has too often left science on the outside looking in. Now, in his first book, Olson, with a Harvard Ph.D. and formerly a tenured professor of marine biology at the University of New Hampshire, recounts the lessons from his own hilarious-and at times humiliating-evolution from science professor to Hollywood filmmaker. In Don\\'t Be Such a Scientist, he shares the secrets of talking substance in an age of style. The key, he argues, is to stay true to the facts while tapping into something more primordial, more irrational, and ultimately more human. In a book enlivened by a profane acting teacher who made Olson realize that \"nobody wants to watch you think,\" he offers up serious insights and poignant stories.
